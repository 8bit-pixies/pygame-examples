# pygame examples

Python [Arcade](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/) as a wealth of examples. Whereas it may be difficult to find similar examples for `pygame`.

This repository attempts two things:

- Provide examples which mirror [Arcade](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/)
- Ensure examples are compatible with [pygbag](https://github.com/pygame-web/pygbag)

To promote ease and speed of development, we will use only [one tileset](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/tiny-dungeon) and use [bitmap fonts](https://kenney.nl/assets/kenney-fonts), using the simple [Catppuccin (Mocha)](https://catppuccin.com/palette) color scheme when appropriate.

[See the docs](https://8bit-pixies.github.io/pygame-examples/)
